**OpenMMDL Simulation Output Files**
=================================

The **OpenMMDL Simulation** script creates output folders and files during and after the simulation.

The following list contains a detailed overview of the folders and files:
The Optional files are highlighted with an *asterisk**

Input Files
------------------------------
**Input Files**: A folder that contains the PDB and SDF files, which served as input files for the MD simulation.
