OpenMMDL
------------------------------------

Can i install OpenMMDL on my personal computer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**OpenMMDL** is available for Linux and Mac systems. **OpenMMDL Setup** and **OpenMMDL Simulation** are incompatible with Windows systems, thus only **OpenMMDL Analysis** of the **OpenMMDL** package can be used on Windows systems.


OpenMMDL Setup
------------------------------------

Do i need to prepare the protein before using OpenMMDL Setup?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**OpenMMDL Setup** is able to prepare the protein for you in the PDBFixer path and add the missing residues in addition to protonating the protein, but it is not able to cap the residues and the prefered input for OpenMMDL Setup is a protein, which is already prepared by a user with having the missing residues modelled and the termini capped.
