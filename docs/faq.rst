Building and publishing your project
------------------------------------

Why does my project have status "failing"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects have the status "failing" because something in the build process has failed.
This can be because the project is not correctly configured,
because the contents of the Git repository cannot be built,
or in the most rare cases because a system that Read the Docs connects to is not working.

First, you should check out the :guilabel:`Builds` tab of your project.
By clicking on the failing step,
you will be able to see details that can lead to resolutions to your build error.

If the solution is not self-evident,
you can use an important word or message from the error to search for a solution.
