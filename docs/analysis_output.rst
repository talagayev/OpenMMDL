**OpenMMDL Analysis Output Files**
=================================

The **OpenMMDL Analysis** script creates output folders and files during and after the analysis.

The following list contains an detailed overview of the folders and files:
The Optional files are highlighted with an *asteriks**


The following Files are generated and stored directly in the working folder where you start the **OpenMMDL Analysis** from:
